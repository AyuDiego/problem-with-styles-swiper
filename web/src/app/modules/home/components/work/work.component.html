        <p class="right-container--text-description ">I've been working as a front-end developer and designer since 2017. I've always been someone who has both a creative and logical side.
          <br>
          When I discovered web design while studying graphic design. I realized it would be the perfect fit. I could use my creative side to design and my logical side to code. Plus, being both a designer and a developer allows me to make sure that no detail is lost in the translation of ideas. </p>
